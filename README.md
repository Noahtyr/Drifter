<h2> Hello & Welcome! </h2>

This is a small indie game that I am working on. Currently, the game features some very simple movement on a long ( Not endless) ground, the purpose of the game is to dogde ALL obstacles in your way, to make sure you reach the end.... but where is the end?



<h2> World is against you, but you can get help! </h2>

<h1> Fight through hell and never look back! </h1>

While you are drifting your way, boosts will appear on the road, which if you pick up, can get a massive increase in speed! more power-ups will be implemented, like damage immunity.
