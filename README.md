<h2> Hello & Welcome! </h2>

This is a small indie game that I am working on. Currently, the game features some very simple movement on a long ( Not endless) ground, the purpose of the game is to dogde ALL obstacles in your way, to make sure you reach the end.... but where is the end?


# Eternity awaits, where does it end?
Power through the endless void to reach the end of the path, but where does it end? does it ever end?

# Fight through hell and never look back!
The more you progress, the more dangerous is becomes, fight through it to prove your worth!

While you are drifting your way, boosts will appear on the road, which if you pick up, can get a massive increase in speed! more power-ups will be implemented, like damage immunity.
